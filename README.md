# Sonar Detection: Rock vs. Mine Classifier 🚢💥
Welcome to Sonar-Detection, a sleek machine learning project that harnesses the power of sonar readings to classify underwater objects as either Rocks or Mines. Built with a straightforward yet effective Logistic Regression model, this project showcases how simple ML techniques can tackle real-world challenges like naval mine detection.
# 🌟 Project Overview
This project uses sonar signal data to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine. By analysing sonar readings, the model delivers accurate classifications, making it a great starting point for exploring machine learning in a practical, high-stakes context.
# Key Features
Logistic Regression Model: A robust, interpretable ML algorithm for binary classification.<br/>
Real-World Application: Inspired by sonar-based detection systems used in maritime environments.<br/>
# 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains sonar readings with features representing signal patterns, labeled as either "Rock" or "Mine." Each row captures 60 sonar signal features, making it a rich dataset for binary classification.
# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.<br/>
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.<br/>
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.<br/>
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive model development and visualization.
